RFID-BASED SMART STICKER FOR PARKING SYSTEM IN IIUM

The goal of this project is to propose and construct a smart sticker system based on RFID technology to enhance parking management at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). Congested traffic and illegal parking in restricted areas tend to be caused by the campus's manual system, which requires security officers to glance over vehicle stickers at the entrance one by one. In order to solve this problem, the proposed system automates the verification of vehicle access using RFID and a real-time database.

An interview was conducted to learn about the current issues before choosing an iterative development approach to develop the system. Then, a prototype was developed followed by storing the data such as access logs and vehicle information in the database. Additionally, if an unregistered vehicle attempts to enter any restricted area or any user leaves their vehicle parked for an extended period of time, the system will trigger alerts to the security officers and users themselves. 

This system helps reduce traffic congestion and reduces the manual workload for security staff.
